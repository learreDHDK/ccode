<h2>Introduction and scenario</h2>
<p>
	CCode project has been carried out for the exam Open Access and Digital Ethics as a Digital Humanities and Digital Knowlegde 		course at the University of Bologna.
	The aim of the project is the analysis and the further re-use of open access datasets, in order to find some kind of new 		knowledge reachable through the mashup of the original data.
	The scenario object of our study is the one concerning the climate change.
	What interested us was to go a step further in showing (in addition to the data symbol of climate change e.g. the increasing of 	the temperatures) even the connection between the climate change and:
	<li>The commitments undertaken by the countries to fight it (agreements, funds)</li>
	<li>The opinions of the citizens</li>
</p>

<p>
	We selected 15 datasets, each collecting data about natural events, the commitments of the countries to fight the climate change 	and the opinions of the citizens about it. Almost all the datasets depict the global situation, while the datasets on citizens’ 	opinions depicts the European situation.
	On these datasets we perform several analysis under different point of views, then we extracted the data which we were 			interested in and finally we created 3 new datasets which collected the data according to our areas of interests:
	<li>Natural events/disasters</li>
	<li>(come definisco ghg e footprint?) Commitments of the countries</li>
	<li>Opinions of the citizens</li>
</p>

<h2>Legal analysis</h2>
<h2>Ethical analysis</h2>
<p>In order to carry out the ethical analysis on the original datasets, we relied on the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/737137/Data_Ethics_Framework.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0Ebh7ZyY-PkNbfLKlATHL1VYDBHge9XLuYtX-MceYq_JZujpptendmwNA">Data Ethics Framework</a>. We organized our analysis of each dataset according to several point of views: transparency, accountability, discrimination, cognitive bias and prejudice.</p>
<p>
In particular, we tried to analyze each of this aspects organizing our analysis in 4 areas:
<li><b>The purpose</b>: what is the goal the dataset wants to achieve?</li>
<li><b>The process</b>: how were the data collected? </li>
<li><b>The output </b>: how was the dataset released? </li>
<li><b>Conclusion</b>: summary</li>
</p>

<h3>Droughts events 1980-2001</h3>
<p><b>Purpose</b>: this dataset is part of the wider “Global risk data platform” which also included data about other natural hazards. The purpose of the platform is to allow the visualisation of data on natural hazards.</p>
<p><b>Process</b>:  the data have been collected by merging data from different sources (that were cited on the website). In this case the sources were: a global monthly gridded precipitation dataset obtained from the Climatic Research Unit (University of East Anglia) and a GIS modeling of global Standardized Precipitation Index based on Brad Lyon (IRI, Columbia University) methodology. In this way the resulting dataset can be based on two different points of view. 
We don’t know anything from the platform about any prejudice or bias respect to the data collected, but we know that methodologies on hazards modeling were reviewed by a team of 24 independent experts selected by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Education and Scientific Cultural Organization (UNESCO).</p>
<p><b>Output</b>: the resulting dataset is not easily understandable because there is no legend to interpret the column headers (lack of guidelines). A version is not indicated and therefore consistency cannot be ascertained.
The platform provided a series of legal information about the license and the way the datasets can be used by the users (e.g. no commercial purpose). However beside this, there are no notions of discrimination and bias.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>: the dataset can be considered good from an ethical point of view but we cannot say the same about its transparency, because of the lack of the legend.</p>

<h3>Sea Ice and Snow Cover Extent</h3>
<p><b>Purpose</b>: the purpose of providing a tool to see the sea ice extent over years is achieved: users can generate and examine graphs and statistics on ice and snow, or download the data to populate spreadsheets for further analysis.</p>
<p><b>Process</b>: the purpose of providing a tool to see the sea ice extent over years is achieved: users can generate and examine graphs and statistics on ice and snow, or download the data to populate spreadsheets for further analysis.</p>
<p><b>Output</b>: the result is a tool for browsing the sea ice extent from 1979 to 2020 for the Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, and the Globe. Data can be observed monthly or annually. Very poor documentation, no information about restriction of use, bias and discrimination.
</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>: the dataset seems to be free from cognitive bias, however very few documentation is provided.
</p>

<h3>CAIT Paris Contributions Data</h3>
<p><b>Purpose</b>: the purpose of the dataset is to provide a collection of data about the countries which submitted the Paris Agreement in 2015-2016 and their commitments in the field of climate change. 
The  purpose is achieved because the structured data from the CAIT Paris Contributions Map enables users to explore, compare, and assess the greenhouse gas mitigation plans in each country's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC).
 </p>
<p><b>Process</b>: after the submission of the Paris Agreement, countries decided to release public outlines of actions they intended to take in order to achieve the goal. The data are structured according to a framework based on several protocols and standards listed on the website. 
The list of the adhesive countries and the license are provided on the first sheet of the dataset.
</p>
<p><b>Output</b>: the output of the process is an interactive map accessible through the platform. By clicking on almost every country (except for Libya for which we don’t have any document submitted), the user can see the information about the agreement for each country separately from the others (the same information provided in the dataset).
The data are about the commitments of each country against climate change, so we can infer that they do not contain prejudices, discriminations and biases.
What about Libya? This is the only case that can create a bias.
A second issue is that the downloadable version of the dataset is updated to 2016, while the user can find on the online platform the data updated to 2019.
</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>: the dataset is almost complete from an ethical point of view, except for information about Libya. The API is easily accessible and transparent, but there is a discrepancy between the downloadable version and the online one.
</p>

<h3>Cumulative data on the contributors of climate finance</h3>
<p><b>Purpose</b>: the purpose of the platform is to present cumulative data on the contributors of climate finance from the multilateral climate change funds monitored by the platform itself. The purpose is achieved.
</p>
<p><b>Process</b>: We don’t know who is the owner of the platform and it is not clear what does it mean that “the data are presented for each multilateral climate change funds it tracks”.
The platform collects the data in the following way: seeks information from different sources and then seeks correspondence with fund managers in order to verify the collected information. Despite this, it is stated that the platform receives verification for almost all funds and it is not indicated which are the authorities that verifies them. All these things can lead to an issue for what concerns reliability.
A positive point is that the platform tracked governed funds focused on climate change and based its dataset on that funds (reliability and transparency).
From the dataset we can infer that the analysed countries are mainly from Europe and Central Asia; no explanations about the choice of the countries (maybe chosen the ones that devoted a good part of the funds to climate change).
No further info about any kind of prejudice or discrimination provided by the platform.
</p>
<p><b>Output</b>: the resulting output is user friendly and easily accessible.
</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>: it is not very clear who verify the funds and how much accurate data are (not very reliable). We can notice that the greater amount of data come from Europe and Central Asia. The resulting API is easily accessible.
</p>

<h3>Special Eurobarometer 313: Europeans’ attitudes towards climate change
</h3>
<p><b>Purpose</b>: The purpose of the dataset is to understand what European citizens think about the climate change situation and what are their expectations for the future.
</p>
<p><b>Process</b>: to be able to accomplish their aim, the opinions of the citizen were collected carrying out surveys which results have been later analysed.
The survey method and questions are described and documented and it is understandable that there is no ethical distortion.
</p>
<p><b>Output</b>: the dataset released contains all the countries of the EU and all the questions and answers are reported without any change. The data collected was used strictly for the purpose of the dataset and there were possibilities of not answering certain questions. So, the possibility of prejudice is excluded and since everybody could take part in the survey we can say there is no discrimination. From the results there is no cognitive bias since there is no interpretation of the results of the dataset just a publication.
</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>: </p>

<h3>GFED4 burned area</h3>
<p><b>Purpose</b>: the data has a clear user need which is to provide global estimates of monthly burned area, monthly emissions and fractional contributions of different fire types, daily/3-hourly fields to scale the monthly emissions to higher temporal resolutions, and data for monthly biosphere fluxes which could be used for large-scale modeling studies. 
</p>
<p><b>Process</b>:  from a legal point of view the data is on point. The collection of the data used is done without any discrimination, cognitive bias or prejudice as inferred on the website (https://daac.ornl.gov/VEGETATION/guides/fire_emissions_v4.html) making use of the available data from other sources and theirs (Satellite information) to create a global view of the situation. The only note could be that they make no mention of licences for use of data from others.
</p>
<p><b>Output</b>: the data used serves exactly the need of the user they want to satisfy and is restricted to its purpose of creation. The dataset released at the end is available in an open format and free for reuse on an API platform. The dataset will in no way harm any individual person,community or country or public interest even with new events registered from the documentation. There is a clear description of the composition of the database again free from any discrimination,cognitive bias or prejudice.
</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>: we can in summary say that the dataset from an ethical point of view is clean to an extent.
</p>

<h3>Climate at a Glance: Global Time Series</h3>
<p><b>Purpose</b>: they don’t state clearly what is the purpose of the dataset created or the user need to which they are responding to but it is inferred that they want to make known to all what is the situation of the temperature anomalies in the world over the years</p>
<p><b>Process</b>:  for the creation of the final dataset, they combine data from two resources (Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly (GHCN-M) data set and International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS)) known for  carrying out quality controls on their data for good practice. Their choice of sources is understood which goes to rhyme with the purpose and helps answer strictly to the user's need identified. Therefore no discrimantion, prejudice or cognitive bias.
</p>
<p><b>Output</b>:  the dataset released from this combination is made available to all in an open format having all the information it had planned to deliver without any wrong ethical aspect. Good explanation of the basis of the results found in the dataset.
</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>: it can be therefore considered that the dataset is ethically correct.</p>


<h3>Threatened species</h3>
<p><b>Purpose</b>: the purpose of the dataset is clearly stated and it is to show the numbers of known species (or assessed) and threatened species with the aim of indicating the state of mammals, birds, freshwater fish, reptiles, amphibians, vascular plants, mosses, lichens and invertebrates. This purpose has no issue of discrimination, cognitive bias or prejudice because most especially it goes for world information and also consider information from the various national Delegates. 
</p>
<p><b>Process</b>:  the process of collection and analysis of the data to create the dataset is done by updating and revising certain information from the comments of national Delegates. The basis of this act is not well stated on the website. So, it could be inferred that  there may be some cognitive bias in the decision making.
</p>
<p><b>Output</b>: the released dataset is done through an API free to all but it is stated on the website that the interpretation should take in consideration the possibility of non exactness of the various values. Also they talk of the possibility of biased results due to overestimation of some of the incompletely evaluated groups of species likely to be threatened in certain countries.
</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>: the level of ethical correctness of this data set is not completely good because in the end we have a dataset of which some values may be wrong due to certain actions during its creation.
</p>

<h3>Climate Change Indicators: U.S. and Global Precipitation</h3>
<p><b>Purpose</b>:  the purpose of creation of the dataset is clear and has no ethical distortion for the precise user need which was to point out all the precipitation anomalies over the given period selected.
</p>
<p><b>Process</b>: during the creation of the dataset they make use of all possible resources to create a well informed database on the subject matter. The good aspect is the fact that during the creation they make use of bias correction software ( automated bias correction software) which helps identify and eliminate biases. Also the personal intervention of the staff, scientists and data quality tests are done in the light of excluding any ethical compromise. 
</p>
<p><b>Output</b>: the datasets released are well documented and are available without charge through NCEI's anonymous FTP service. The information it contains is of good quality and satisfies the user's need and purpose of creation.
</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>: this dataset can be consequently considered ethically correct.
</p>


<h3>Special Eurobarometer 409: Climate change</h3>
<p><b>Purpose</b>: the purpose of the dataset is to understand what European citizens think of the climate change situations and what are their expectations.
</p>
<p><b>Process</b>: to be able to accomplish their aim, they carry out surveys to collect opinions of the citizens and analyse the results. The survey method and questions are described and documented and it is understandable that there is no ethical distortion.
</p>
<p><b>Output</b>: the dataset released contains all the countries of the EU and all the questions and answers are reported without any change. The data collected was used strictly for the purpose of the dataset and there were possibilities of not answering certain questions. So, the possibility of prejudice is excluded and since everybody could take part in the survey we can say there is no discrimination. From the results there is no cognitive bias since there is no interpretation of the results of the dataset just a publication.

</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>: it can be said that, some questions included in the dataset went to individuate certain aspects of the life of the citizens (like their economic status) without really giving a reason for this. So, we will say that the dataset to an extent is not ethically correct because data analists can nevertheless infer much information from the personality of European citizens and their reactions to climate change.
